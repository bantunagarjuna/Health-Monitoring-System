# Health-Monitoring-System

Project Report
IoT Healthcare
Healthcare has always been one of the most crucial sectors in our society, with the advancement in technology the healthcare sector has evolved and become more sophisticated. Internet of Things(IoT) has become very popular in recent times due to its ability to connect devices and collect data. Continuous and remote monitoring of a person’s health is becoming increasingly important in today’s world. IoT devices can be used to monitor a person’s health remotely without requires the presence of a caregiver. This project proposes the use of IoT technology in the healthcare sector to monitor a person’s health continuously and remotely.

To monitor a person’s health continuously, an IoT device is used to detect various health readings from the body. The IoT device is integrated with various sensors like ECG sensor, Blood Pressure sensor, and Temperature sensor. These sensor help in collecting the vital data parameters from the body, the collected data is then pre-processed to fit into the deep learning model. The deep leaning model detects any anomaly in the body signals and sends alerts to the corresponding platforms.

ECG sensor are used to monitor the electrical activity of the heart, ECG readings provide information about the hearts rhythm and can detect abnormal heartbeats. PPG sensor are used to measure the blood flow through the skin. Blood pressure sensor are used to measure the pressure of the blood flowing through the arteries. Blood pressure readings provide information about the hearts pumping action and can detect high or low blood pressure. Temperature sensor are used to measure the temperature of the body. Temperature readings provide information about the body’s metabolic activity.

The IoT device collect the data from the sensor continuously and transmits the data to the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi stores the data and processes it using the deep learning model. The deep learning model is trained using various deep learning models to detect the any anomaly in the body signals. The model detects any deviation from the normal range and sends alerts to the corresponding platforms, the alerts can be sent to the patient’s mobile phone, email or a healthcare professional. The healthcare professionals can then take appropriate actions based on the alert received.

In conclusion, the proposed project uses IoT technology to monitor a person’s health continuously and remotely. The IoT device is integrated with various sensors to collect vital data parameters from the body. The collected data is then pre-processed to fit into the deep learning model. The deep learning model detects any anomaly in the body signals and send alerts to the corresponding platforms. The use of deep learning algorithms in the healthcare applications has been widely researched and proposed in various research papers.
